Part III. You are welcome to reuse code you wrote for assignment 1,
but we would like to know how you handled the following tasks.

5. How did you calculate precision, recall and F1 score? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it.
	I have calculated precision, recall and F1 score in per_classify script and the script outputs the statistics to the console after running per_classify script on dev data

6. How did you separate 10% of the training data? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it. Explain how you or your code choose the files.
	10% of the training data was created manually. 10% of total files (10% of train data: 1702) was calculated and selected half of the files to be ham (851 ham files) and the other half of the files to be spam examples (851 spam files), and per_learn, avg_per_learn scripts were run on 10% training data and ran per_classify script on dev data to calculate the performance for standard and averaged perceptron model.
